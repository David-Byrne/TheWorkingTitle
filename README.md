# TheWorkingTitle
First year group project in C-Programming: A bookshop's website using CGI (in C) on the server.
It was built by myself, [Labhras](https://github.com/worhello) and Hasan.

It's currently hosted at http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/WT/ however since this server doesn't support CGI, many features don't work there.
